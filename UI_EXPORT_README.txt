This export contains the UI/CSS and related components from the Final-UI project.
Files included:
- src/app/globals.css (Tailwind + custom CSS variables)
- src/app/layout.tsx and src/app/page.tsx (if present)
- src/components and src/components/ui (React components used in UI)
- src/lib and src/hooks (utility functions used by UI)
- public/* (images and svg assets)
- postcss.config.mjs, tailwind.config.js, package.json, next.config.ts

How to use:
1. Copy the included files/folders into the root of a Next.js (app-router) project.
2. Ensure 'tailwindcss' and 'autoprefixer' are installed and PostCSS configured.
3. Run `npm install` and `npm run dev`.
4. If you only need the CSS for static HTML, copy globals.css and public assets into your target project and ensure Tailwind directives are processed during build.

Notes:
- This export includes component logic (TSX). If you paste into a non-React environment, you'll need to adapt them.
